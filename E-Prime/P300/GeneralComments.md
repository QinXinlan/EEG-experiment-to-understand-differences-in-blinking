It is not always easy to display videos with E-Prime. In my case, it worked with ".mpg" files.
I chose to use 40 different sequences in which for each image, 6 letters are highlited. For each letter, it is impossible to be highlighted at the same time as its neighbours.

In the four letters P300, the following words are used:
* WITH
* HOME
* GOOD
* YOUR
* FROM
* MUCH
* THEM
* 6_17

In the five letters P300, the following words are used:
* BLACK
* ENJOY
* PRIZE
* EQUAL
* FALSE
* HEAVY
* EXACT
* JUNE88
* 13_59
